officer during a period of intense fighting in Europe Our protagonist herself is a medium stationed in the French port city of Le Havre working for the Spirit Corps a classified spiritualist project developed by Britain to gain an advantage over the Germans br br In the British army each soldier goes through a top secret conditioning process to ensure that upon their deaths their spirits will return to Le Havre so that the mediums there can take their report It s their final service to their country passing on potential valuable intelligence like enemy troop movements and tactics As a member of the Corps Ginger s job is to talk to the ghosts of these slain soldiers collect their information and pass it on through to the right people If the Germans find out about what they re doing here the consequences can be devastating However Ginger s fianc Captain Benjamin Harford being one of the key figures involved in the running of the Spirit Corps is already suspicious that their secret may be out due to some recent strange activity Ginger is soon made aware of a possible traitor in their midst and while Ben is away at the front the two of them exchange coded messages to share what they know Together they work to uncover a spy and put a stop to the German s attempts to target the Spirit Corps br br There s also a major plot development that happens near the beginning of the book and although the publisher description doesn t mention it it s so obvious it s coming that I m not even sure it would constitute as a spoiler Still I ll err on the side of caution and won t reveal it even if it will make writing the rest of this review more difficult Without going into specific details I think it is enough to say that this particular development will lead to some very poignant and emotional moments Ginger felt very genuine to me which of course is crucial to my enjoyment of a main character and her story br br I also enjoyed the ideas here Often when a book calls to me there is a specific hook to the description that initially catches my attention For Ghost Talkers it was unquestionably the concept of a Spirits Corps of mediums working for the army The idea that the military would find a strategic use for ghosts and isn t really beyond the pale and Kowal does a great job developing the ins-and-outs behind what Ginger and her fellow mediums do br br However while world-building is fantastic on a micro-level when it comes to relating it all back to the wider world out there and the history of the times that s where the seams of this novel start to show When it comes to historical fantasy and alternate history fiction atmosphere is always going to be more important than the details for me and the main issue I had with the world-building here was that even though I knew I was reading a book set during WWI the story never truly made me feel like I was there I really liked how Kowal addresses many social issues at the time such as the systemic sexism and racism but while I applaud her intentions in the process of tying her story together she also rushes through convenient resolutions which glosses over the harshness of the reality It s also not very clear how the Corps came to be and the workings behind the huge network of people involved in maintaining its secrecy For example the story mentions a couple of famous figures like Harry Houdini or Arthur Conan Doyle who are actually accomplices for the British government working on their behalf to cover up spiritualism and ghost-talking by actively debunking things like that in public Without more context on the history of the Spirit Corps and how such a huge endeavor was pulled together though all this comes across as mere name dropping and a slapdash way to try and connect readers to the historical era br br The story was also entirely too predictable playing out like a conventional mystery especially since it wasn t subtle at all when it came to dropping false leads so it was just a matter of the process of elimination to identify the traitor br br Still the characters and their relationships shine even if the plot and setting are weaker And truly I think the ultimate strength behind Ghost Talkers lies in its ideas about the Spirit Corps Imagine having to interact with the departed souls of thousands of soldiers many of whom died violently and unexpectedly All ghosts and mediums know that they have a job to do but reading about Ginger s attempts to provide comfort and assurances to the spirits before they dissipate into the great unknown was both tragic and touching br br So if the book s description catches your interest I think that s reason enough to check this one out I wish the story had been expanded a little to create a more immersive atmosphere or to include some context and background information about the Corps but perhaps that can be addressed with future books This was a fast enjoyable novel and I m glad I read it

 This book swept me up in it and didn t let go until it was over It s rare for me to read something without putting it down at this point in my life but the combination of short word count and breakneck pacing kept my eyes glued to the pages Ginger is a wonderful protagonist who is smart and kind and has the fiery temper you might expect from a woman called Ginger but she s definitely more than that stereotype as well Her interactions with Helen the other medium in her circle who s a span span id freeText style display none This book swept me up in it and didn t let go until it was over It s rare for me to read something without putting it down at this point in my life but the combination of short word count and breakneck pacing kept my eyes glued to the pages Ginger is a wonderful protagonist who is smart and kind and has the fiery temper you might expect from a woman called Ginger but she s definitely more than that stereotype as well Her interactions with Helen the other medium in her circle who s a black woman from the Caribbean also doing her part for the war effort set her apart from others in the story notably authority figures going a long way toward showing rather than telling the reader about her kind nature Ginger s interactions with those authority figures are another of the great characterization points in the story particularly from the beginning of the book to the end br br The first big twist in this story was completely unexpected and changed my expectations for the book but in a really good way I like when the stakes get raised even if I don t particularly like i how i the stakes get raised I saw the other twist coming a bit before the reveal but just like Ginger I wanted rather badly for it not to be true so I was hoping something else might be the case instead br br If you re looking for a wonderful mix of history fantasy mystery romance Ghost Talkers is really perfect I loved it and I hope there are more books in this setting to come br br My review copy was provided via NetGalley

have a cup of tea and a bit of a chat with a pretty lady maybe a dance so they can have a bit of normalcy when they get away from the front But the spirits the Corps are dealing with aren t just of the morale boasting variety The tents and the tea besides providing much needed support are also the front for their real purpose spiritualism Ginger is a medium and she works with her circle to take the reports of recently fallen soldiers Each soldier before heading to the front is conditioned to report to Potter s Field when they die The giant warehouse chilled by the spirits coming through has circles of two mediums and their anchors waiting for the dead to tell their final minutes Conditioned to report on their death and any other important details such as troop positions or gun turrets these soldiers don t die in vain They are able to give vital information after their last breath and go to their well deserved rest br br There are two things keeping Ginger at her post While the valuable work she is doing is of the utmost importance it would be a lie to say that she doesn t take comfort in being near her fiance Captain Benjamin Hartshorne Yet something odd happens when Ben is at the front There is evidence from two different sources that the Germans are not only aware of the true purpose of the Spirit Corps but that the Corps is being targeted The higher ups won t listen to Ginger thinking that it s utter nonsense that the Spirit Corps is being targeted She needs Ben to back her up He s an intelligence officer and his voice is heard in meetings where she s often asked to get the tea But then everything changes Ginger s greatest fear has always been that Ben would report in to Potter s Field There s a huge backlog one day and Ginger fears that all these deaths were for one purpose only to stall the Spirit Corps so valuable information can t get through Valuable information that Ben might have when Ginger spots him When she realizes he is dead her world collapses But Ben isn t like the other ghosts checking in he s not going to rest until he finds his killer and protects the Spirit Corps with the help of Ginger br br i Ghost Talkers i is Mary Robinette Kowal s first novel not set within the world of the Glamourist Histories which I love so dearly I am all for authors branching out especially when they maintain their quality of prose character creation and worldbuilding like Mary does her Instead of creating an alternate history we are given more a secret history with i Ghost Talkers i The Spirit Corps could actually have existed as a shadowy organization and I think that is one of the things that I love most about this book The fact that it could have been Working within the actual framework of history to create a story that isn t just plausible by possible to the reader is a grand achievement The conceit with how the Spirit Corps collects information just makes sense To use two mediums and a circle of other people who would otherwise have nothing to give to the war effort from old women to wounded soldiers as their anchor to this plane of existence just seems logical The way Mary describes how the mediums experience the reporting soldiers last minutes as well as the toll on their bodies to the lure of just letting go of your decaying heavy corporeal form it s so real that it s like you re reading about something that happened and who s to say it didn t br br But Mary takes her spiritbuilding beyond just the simple exchange of information from a reporting dead solider to a medium With the death of Ben we get to see the spirit realm not just from Ginger s point of view but also from Ben s which is piercing the veil The way Ginger sees Ben as shifting from standing to sitting to rocking to saluting all at once makes you not just see the transitory state Ben is trapped in but it also latches onto the fact that ghosts are entities of emotion and emotions from rage to love can all exist simultaneously much as Ben does in all these different stances The idea that ghosts are really echoes and impressions of past emotions isn t a new concept but the way Mary shows us how Ben is an amalgamation of these concentrated emotions gives a new depth to not only how we view the concept of ghosts in this world but also a deeper understanding of what exactly is left of Ben and how Ginger loves him dearly What I found most fascinating though was the idea that a ghost whose emotions take him over is what is a poltergeist Ben could forever be trapped in that one emotion rage or fear or despair Forever You can see why Ginger does all she can to ground him Not just out of fear of what could be but love for what a great man she lost br br This nailing of ghostly interaction while making it wholly her own isn t the only instance of Mary being able to take something that is ephemeral and give it a voice that we as readers relate to I am speaking of Ginger s dreams or nightmares in some cases Now you might be wondering how can a dream sequence be wrong everyone dreams differently and therefore there can be all manner of weird dreams Yet correct me if I m wrong but I would be willing to bet good money that you ve been watching some TV show or movie and they ve had a dream sequence and you just didn t think it was believable There wasn t enough grounding in the character s reality and they just went for the gimmicky and the weird versus the believable Because believe you me dreams do have logic Why else would there be so many people trying to interpret them Every dream I have I can tie back to something I ve worried about or seen even if it ends with me in a swimming competition with Captain America I can still tell you where that came from And yes that was a dream I had this week David Lynch and Joss Whedon are what people should aim for and what I think Mary achieved And as for the lucid dreaming That s a whole other level of perfection and horror br br As for grounding in the real world versus the subconscious or supernatural what I found delightful was the mentions of Arthur Conan Doyle and Houdini as agents working to hide the existence of the Spirit Corps and the truth that spiritualism works The real history of this is that Conan Doyle was obsessed with spiritualism belonging to many societies championing the truth of the Cottingley Fairies he wrote books on his beliefs his wife even believed herself to be a medium He was the poster boy for spiritualism Enter his good friend Harry Houdini Houdini was a big mama s boy and when she died he was desperate to make contact with her He wanted to believe in spiritualism but all he saw was people using the same tricks he used in his magic acts to con gullible and grieving people Houdini even offered a cash prize to anyone who could prove they were a real medium Needless to say it was never collected Houdini s zeal in debunking false mediums caused a rift between him and Conan Doyle that turned into public antagonism and hatred Now want if it was all smoke and mirrors What if this big debacle was all masterminded to protect a valuable secret I just get chills thinking about it and hope it s explored further in later books br br The true heart of the novel though is the love between Ginger and Ben If their doomed love wasn t believable than i Ghost Talkers i would not have worked But the problem is we join then relationship firmly established and then challenged To form a bond between readers and the relationship between characters it s often best to see the whole arc of their relationship from beginning to end And while we do get glimpses of the past in Ginger s dreams and in her conversations with Ben it s almost like they re a fait accompli There s nothing left but to wait for their tragic ending So it s hard to see them together We ve just joined them at the end of their story But then that all changed Ginger asks Ben what is was that made him fall in love with her and he talks about her love for Brussels sprouts In this little reminiscence you see the depth of their connection you see their love It s a love story not writ large but writ small the size of a little sprout This somehow makes their connection so real that it physically aches when you think that by the time you finish this book they will no longer be together To get across that it s the little things that make love love shows the depth of Mary s storytelling She gets the little details right and that just helps with the big and then you have a book that feels whole

book So here we go strap in this will likely be a long one br br Anyone who knows me knows I am a sucker for anything related to the World Wars That may sound macabre but I am a history buff so I like reading fiction that intertwines some truth into the fantasy So when I read the description for this book on NetGalley my little history loving heart just couldn t wait to get my hands on it But so many authors have the tendency to muck up the history in favor of drama or to not even mention anything historical which is the whole fun of setting something in a particular time period vs modern day Kowel is not one of these authors She does an AMAZING job of staying true to the history while weaving in the fantasy elements and not making everything seem ridiculous or overly far-fetched I never found myself rolling my eyes or thinking that anything was implausible Actually I kept thinking what a fantastic idea over and over In fact I don t think this plot idea mediums getting info from dead soldiers would ve really worked except in this particular time period when spying and intelligence were of the upmost importance not that they aren t now of course but the human element was of much more use then than it is now br br Without getting bogged down in the details Kowel gives her audience credit and assumes that they know enough about World War I not to explain every detail about the setting so that the book can fill in other details that are more important which is something I appreciate Sometimes in historical books you end up feeling like you re reading a history textbook instead of a fiction book because the author has the characters or the narration explain everything that is happening with the battles or the setting but that was not at all a problem with this book br br Along with the fabulous historical setting came her masterful crafting of characters that were so easy to love from the get-go Being a woman of this time period I adored the fact that Ginger was still a woman of manners and propriety but that she was headstrong and bold too making her own choices and not afraid to stand up for herself and the people she loved All of her actions made complete sense with her character and yet she remained ever the lady of the times And don t even get me started on her fianc Benjamin Be still my heart I don t think I ve ever fallen faster for a leading man then I did for him So sweet protective and the picture of a devoted solider Wow does Kowel know how to write her heartthrobs haha Even the side characters were fantastically written to the point that I had so many emotional moments with even them as the book unfolded Merrow in particular I m still reeling from that one fans self br br Honestly there were so many things about this book I could rave on and on about but the one thing that had me glued to the pages from the start and had me sobbing at the end was the beautiful and tragic romance between Ginger and Ben If you don t read this book for the history or the fantasy or anything else please pick it up for these two characters I had no idea when I started reading how attached to them I would get and how much their story would affect me given how short this book actually is but it is one of the most well written love stories I have read and I don t say that lightly The way that Kowel weaves little pieces of their backstory from the beginning to the end is just stunning and I was left so in love with their story that I still wish there was more br br The ending of the book is why I gave stars instead of It was too bittersweet for me If you read it and my review you ll probably understand why that is Or you can just spoil yourself here a class jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction view spoiler a span class spoilerContainer style

absences when she has let her spirit slip free of it Kowal makes me feel the ick factor of a corporal body and its limitations I never doubted that Ginger put herself at risk and that the survival of

 Ginger is a medium working for a secret section of the British Military during the first World War She and those like her use their powers to gather intelligence reports from recently deceased soldiers to better inform the frontlines Through a seemingly unimportant death Ginger discovers there is a traitor amongst the British soldiers who is trying to find the mediums and reveal their secrets to the Germans br br Spies death mediums romance what more do you want To top it off though this book p span span id freeText style display none Ginger is a medium working for a secret section of the British Military during the first World War She and those like her use their powers to gather intelligence reports from recently deceased soldiers to better inform the frontlines Through a seemingly unimportant death Ginger discovers there is a traitor amongst the British soldiers who is trying to find the mediums and reveal their secrets to the Germans br br Spies death mediums romance what more do you want To top it off though this book puts the feels on you too br br The characters are the real highlight in this book even bit parts are given a depth of attention they rarely receive People you thought well i hope that jerk dies about when they die reveal a side to them that makes you feel REAL guilty you thought that about them You find yourself really intrigued and caring for each and every person and though you KNOW it s war every time you lose one of the characters it s a killer blow I swear I cried more in this book than any other in the last year br br The pacing is good and smooth with a solid velocity how else does a work from home mum get through a book in a meagre two days p br br The concept is definitely very cool too and I was also impressed with the handling of disabled veterans and people of colour I really appreciated how wealthy white American Ginger was able to appreciate that though she is now good friends with a Jamacan medium a year ago she would have been just as appalled as any other member of the aristocracy at her friends presence at their dances yet use that more as a way to keep herself moving forward in pressing for recognition for her friend br br The progression of ghost-hood and how it was depicted throughout was probably one of my favourite things too By the time it was time for someone to go you wanted them to move on because it was clearly time apologies for vagueness not wanting to spoiler anything br br The only thing that pulled me out of the story was her last name This is an utterly trivial thing but her last name is the name of a cheap brand of cigarettes over here in Australia and though I never smoked back when I went out a lot ahh my wild youth p I would often accompany a friend to the servo to buy some late night Stuvveys I couldn t help but think of that whenever someone called her by her last name Lucky she was Ginger most of the time br br Overall it was a surprisingly smashing read I recommend to any fan of mediums paranormal fiction and historical fiction lovers as well as romance fans who want a bit of action with their feels

 My first exposure to Ghost Talkers by Mary Robinette Kowal was hearing her read an excerpt at World Fantasy back when it was still a work in progress I was immediately hooked and wanted more The core concept of the book was just so cool a group of mediums works with the British Army during WWI collecting and relaying intelligence from soldiers killed in battle Kowal takes the story far beyond a cool concept however There is an immediate sense of the emotional and physical toll communicat span span id freeText style display none My first exposure to Ghost Talkers by Mary Robinette Kowal was hearing her read an excerpt at World Fantasy back when it was still a work in progress I was immediately hooked and wanted more The core concept of the book was just so cool a group of mediums works with the British Army during WWI collecting and relaying intelligence from soldiers killed in battle Kowal takes the story far beyond a cool concept however There is an immediate sense of the emotional and physical toll communicating with the dead takes on the mediums not to mention the horrors of war itself Kowal doesn t shy away from the violence and she immediately makes the impact of war personal Her protagonist Ginger Stuyvesant is one of the few Americans involved in the war before America s official entry into the conflict Her fiancee Ben Harford is killed early on remaining with Ginger as a ghost determined to uncover the traitor in the British ranks before he can move on Kowal shows us Ginger and Ben s loving and playful relationship and almost immediately pulls the rug out from under the reader s feet by killing Ben Having him return as a ghost never feels like a cheat Loss is threaded through his ongoing presence the longer he remains on the mortal plane the more he forgets of himself bits of his personality drifting away burning up more quickly when manifests himself as a poltergeist to protect those around him Kowal makes the reader care for every one of her characters Helen the medium working with Ginger who comes up with the method of binding soldiers so they ll report in as ghosts Lady Penfold Ginger s aunt and founder of the Spirit Corp program Pvt Merrow Ben s assistant and the men and women of Ginger s circle who help keep her grounded as she communicates with the dead The novel is part war narrative particularly focusing on the roles of women frequently overlooked in the dominant cultural narrative of war It s also part murder mystery love story and ghost story Kowal slips in bits of humor as well with the banter between Ginger and Ben as well as references to Doctor Who It s a wonderful novel with elements to appeal to fans of historical fiction speculative fiction and romance

 Ok so this may be my favorite of Mary Kowal s books though I think her short story i Kiss Me Twice i is still my favorite And honestly I might have rated this book stars if it weren t for the fact that it is kind of a heartbreaking book something I was neither expecting when I first started or really wanting at the moment That being said it being heartbreaking at times is one of the reasons it is such a great story while being ripe with emotion it is smartly and wonderfully written She does span span id freeText style display none Ok so this may be my favorite of Mary Kowal s books though I think her short story i Kiss Me Twice i is still my favorite And honestly I might have rated this book stars if it weren t for the fact that it is kind of a heartbreaking book something I was neither expecting when I first started or really wanting at the moment That being said it being heartbreaking at times is one of the reasons it is such a great story while being ripe with emotion it is smartly and wonderfully written She doesn t pull her punches and there are certain things she doesn t do because then it would be a different story then the one she was telling Ginger is a medium during WWI receiving the Spirits of soldiers as they come into report They relive death after death take their last messages of love to the families of these men And she makes it so realistic you would think this could actually happen But it s more then that It s a mystery at times a bit of a supernatural thriller or horror novel and yet it is done in such a way it doesn t feel like any of these br br Hurray for it being a standalone novel when everything these days seems to be part of a series I am predisposed to like Mary Kowal s books so I may not be the most unbiased review but she did not disappoint In fact she raised the bar of what I will expect from her If you enjoy good historical fantasy and a good mystery this is a great book br br I do have to note really Mary you have a redheaded main character and named her Ginger Yes I get it is short for Virginia but still come on br br Oh and AFTER reading the book I highly recommend listening to Mary Kowal talk about the book in the Writing Excuses podcast Project in Depth Ghost Talkers I found it very interesting to listen to her discus some of the choices changes and inspirations behind the story

 I always love to see fantasy novels set in time periods that don t get a lot of attention in the genre particularly when they use the language and setting of that time to inform their choices about magic and how it works and this fast-paced fantasy set in World War I definitely qualifies The use of spiritualism which was extremely popular at the time as the root of all the magic in this world really sold it to me as it makes the magic more realistic and rooted in the period br br There had also span span id freeText style display none I always love to see fantasy novels set in time periods that don t get a lot of attention in the genre particularly when they use the language and setting of that time to inform their choices about magic and how it works and this fast-paced fantasy set in World War I definitely qualifies The use of spiritualism which was extremely popular at the time as the root of all the magic in this world really sold it to me as it makes the magic more realistic and rooted in the period br br There had also clearly been some good attention paid to including more of the many different groups of people who were involved in the war effort than most novels of the period will include with important characters of different ethnic backgrounds and ages as well as some who had been disabled in combat but still wanted to serve br br I wasn t entirely satisfied by the last few sections of the book the solutions to some mysteries seemed a little abrupt perhaps but I was carried along quite happily and very much enjoyed the ride

already interesting setting Too often I find that supernatural elements are added to stories for a cool factor rather than being important to the story but nothing in Ghost Talkers feels extraneous br br b Giving a voice to the marginalized in WWI b br br Ghost Talkers is a wartime spy drama told from the perspective of those usually marginalized While the narrative often focuses on the gender inequality of the time period the novel is not just concerned with women but Black women as well This is handled deftly with Ginger making many of the default assumptions the privileged often make She often forgets that Helen does not have the same liberties as the other white women of the Spirit Corps This and when the brass overlook Helen as a potential useful leader because of her colour are the only times her race is ever mentioned As such Kowal is able to address the issues without preaching Helen s colour is so inconsequential to Ginger that she only ever notices the issue when inequality rears its ugly head br br Amongst the marginalized voices represented in the novel are the oft-overlooked members of the Commonwealth Indians Many Indians fought for Britain in the war yet they were relegated to less glamorous work Not because they lacked the training but purely out of prejudice Ginger befriends an Indian driver who highlights these issues to her something Ginger attempts to rectify while her own rights as a woman are still curtailed The marginalized fighting for the marginalized After all it s the same fight br br b Is this twist earned b br br My one complaint about the novel is also perhaps a strength of Kowal s writing Like any good spy thriller the character revealed as a traitor took me by surprise And I was fuming I liked that character How dare she make them a baddie Once I got over my initial shock I racked my brain for earlier clues to hint at the betrayal I had been so blinded by the pov character s likes and dislikes prejudices and suspicions that I had completely missed what had been staring me in the face Well done Kowal well done But that doesn t mean I forgive you br br Verdict Ghost Talkers is fabulous from beginning to end The rich setting is only improved by the addition of Kowal s supernatural elements and the mystery is gripping throughout

 I must admit that I really enjoyed this book because it s well written and has a rather unusual premise I ve seen stories taken place during World War II and stories taking place during earlier periods like the Civil War in the US or the Gold Rush not to mention all the regency novels But this is the first time I come across a book taking place during World War I And this book not only uses WWI as the background for the story but makes the war its integral part br br Ginger Stuyvesant is a medi span span id freeText style display none I must admit that I really enjoyed this book because it s well written and has a rather unusual premise I ve seen stories taken place during World War II and stories taking place during earlier periods like the Civil War in the US or the Gold Rush not to mention all the regency novels But this is the first time I come across a book taking place during World War I And this book not only uses WWI as the background for the story but makes the war its integral part br br Ginger Stuyvesant is a medium in the Spirit Corps a special Spiritual Force within the British army Each soldier is conditioned to report to the Spirit Corps after they die and give all the details of the location and manner of their death as well as what they heard and saw at those last moments before they can move on to the afterlife Ginger and the other mediums are in charge of documenting this and passing the relevant information up the chain of command br br This is a thankless and grueling job because there aren t enough mediums so they have to work double if not triple shifts and the casualties keep piling up The mediums are at the verge of collapsing from exhaustion and their circles are just as worn out but there seems to be no end in sight br br One day Ginger takes the last report of a ghost that hints at the fact that the Spirit Corps are not as secret as they thought they were and that the Germans are not only aware of them but are actively seeking to destroy the mediums More worrying still the ghost hints that there is a traitor within the British command Ginger goes to her superiors only to be ridiculed and sent home but she won t just sit still and watch the events play out not when the lives of those she loves are on the line br br I loved the attention to detail the author put into this book It touches on a number or important subjects like the role of women in society at that time or the disdain towards people of color who even though they fought in the war and died alongside white soldiers were still considered second rate citizens at best br br I loved how well-developed and alive all the characters were in this book even the secondary and tertiary ones They all felt like real people with their own hopes and stories all of them worthy of a novel of their own and that s a big accomplishment br br Ginger is a capable young woman who stands up for those she loves even if that means going against racial prejudice and injustice like in the case of the medium who she thinks is more than capable of serving as liaison between the Spirit Corps and the commanding officers in her stead but the medium being black and a woman to boot this idea is promptly shut down I love that Ginger judges people by their personal worth not by their skin color or place in society br br At the same time I love that Ginger isn t depicted as a feminist I m pretty sure that notion didn t exist at that time yet or even a suffragette She is very much the product of her time and her upbringing and she behaves in accordance with the rules of polite society of that time even if she pushes the boundaries a little when she needs to br br The story itself is fast-moving and packed with action but also has poignant and heartbreaking moments as well as providing a pertinent commentary on prejudice misogyny and racism My only complaint is that the ending was rather underwhelming but it was logical and in line with the world that was depicted in the book br br So all in all it was a fun and refreshing read and I really loved it I would definitely recommend it to my friends and I hope that there will be a second book set in this world someday br br PS I received an advanced reader copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review

 I have never come across a story quite like Ghost Talkers The description got me excited as soon as I read it what if we lived in a world where Spiritualism was real You know the ghost and medium and s ance stuff that was popular at the time of WWI Why the military would use it of course Ghosts reporting to mediums from the front lines What a great way to gain intelligence about the enemy s movements br br So Ghost Talkers has a unique interesting idea that hooked me to the story right away span span id freeText style display none I have never come across a story quite like Ghost Talkers The description got me excited as soon as I read it what if we lived in a world where Spiritualism was real You know the ghost and medium and s ance stuff that was popular at the time of WWI Why the military would use it of course Ghosts reporting to mediums from the front lines What a great way to gain intelligence about the enemy s movements br br So Ghost Talkers has a unique interesting idea that hooked me to the story right away But we know that it takes more than a good idea to make a good novel I am pleased to report that Ghost Talkers follows through introducing us to wonderful characters giving us a perspective of WWI that we don t often see and taking us on a thrilling impossible-to-put-down plot br br The story follows Ginger Stuyvecant an American medium working for the British Spirit Corps who spends her days meeting the recent causalities of war and taking their final reports She is engaged to Ben Harford a British Intelligence Officer Between them they discover that a traitor is feeding the Germans information about the Spirit Corps and that the mediums are in danger There are few people they can trust forcing Ginger to go to the front to uncover the truth br br We end up with a novel that is part spy thriller part romance and part fantasy And all the parts work The workings of the spirit corps are believable and presented as somewhat scientific The relationship between Ben and Ginger felt real and beautiful The characterisation in general was on point I sometimes found it difficult to keep track of the supporting characters but most got moments to shine and some I grew quite attached to br br The depiction of war was not as brutal as I m used to but I feel it had the right amount of blood and gore for this story Ghost Talkers is also interesting in that it shows the Great War from a woman s perspective For the past years we have celebrated the bravery of the men on the frontlines Rightfully so life in the trenchers was horrific The constant shelling was enough to drive people crazy and the courage needed to go over the top into the face of machine gun fire is unimaginable What we often forget about are the women who were right in the thick of the war as nurses ambulance drivers doctors and motorcycle dispatch riders A lot of the mediums who are mostly women experience a form of shell shock from having to relieve the deaths of hundreds of soldiers In an afterward to the book Kowal mentions that a lot of what the mediums suffer through was based off the experiences of female ambulance drivers who were right there in the battlefield and often experienced PTSD br br Ginger s point of view also allows us to explore the institutional sexism and racism present in turn of the century British culture It was mostly explored well though I feel at times I was being slammed over the head with the message I do feel that Ginger might have been a little bit too st Century in expressing her views it didn t really gel with the setting However I do like that she is a character with strong convictions who is not afraid to voice them br br I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the romance part of this story I don t really want to say much about it for potential spoiler reasons but if you are put off by the idea of a romance story rest assured everything is all good br br I ve been disappointed before by picking up books with awesome ideas that then turn out to not have enough story to support the idea This is not one of those cases Ghost Talkers is a wonderful ghost-spy-mystery-war-romance story that I have no qualms recommending to anyone Even if you think ghost or romance or war might not be your thing

 Mary Robinette Kowal did an excellent job with Ghost Talkers Although this is a piece of fiction and can almost be regraded as fantasy at times Kowal does justice to those who served in WWI especially the women who served span span div
 When I pick up a Mary Robinette Kowal book I know for certain that I m going to get something original well written and great And I got that br br There are so many things I liked about this book but what I loved the most was the idea It s just so damn cool So In this version of the events of WWI British soldiers heading for the front are made to in the tragic event of dying remember everything they see or hear and report it to the Spirit Corps Our heroine medium Ginger works there and h span span id freeText style display none When I pick up a Mary Robinette Kowal book I know for certain that I m going to get something original well written and great And I got that br br There are so many things I liked about this book but what I loved the most was the idea It s just so damn cool So In this version of the events of WWI British soldiers heading for the front are made to in the tragic event of dying remember everything they see or hear and report it to the Spirit Corps Our heroine medium Ginger works there and her job is to communicate with the newly passed soldiers and gather information that might help to win the war And I just think that s so clever Kowal always manages to flawlessly bring fantasy elements together with real historical events and it always becomes entirely believable and exciting br br As this story is set in the midst of war our book plays out entirely within the fences of it We are on battle fields camps secret hideouts and everything else war-ish I love it It s raw and dirty and makes for a perfect backdrop to this spy novel br br And as one could guess from a war spy story it s very action packed Things are happening all the time Conspiracies backstabbing explosions fights chases and epic throw downs But even though it was very event packed Kowal has such a sense of pace and never goes to slowly or to quickly But this book has a story that s fighting against the clock so even though there was pauses of reflection character development and other moments in between the story still had to move quite steadily forward br br All of the above can t survive on it s own without a great heroine and our Ginger is just fab She is rational smart feisty and deals so well with all the bullshit sexism she has to go through in this man dominated field But there is one man not behaving as a douche bag and that is her fiance Ben br br Besides combining fantasy and history Kowal is especially good at making believable love stories She manages to avoid the mushy and cheesy and always creates something mature and real I loved Ben and Ginger together and their love brings this story forward br br Now There is an event that happens early on that I would like to talk more about but as I don t wish to spoil things and as they have managed quite impressively not mention it in the plot description I ll have to talk about it in a very round about way But as the story is set up we know almost from the beginning how one aspect of the story will end And it s heartbreaking I kept hoping that somehow the inevitable would not happen and there would be a loophole but no So it ends on a bittersweet note that I should ve been able to mentally prepare for throughout but that somehow still made me cry And I think that was so well done of Kowal Pressing on my emotional buttons and making me live on hope although there was no hope to be had Damn you Mary br br To conclude I very much enjoyed this book and I can t wait to read from Mary again either in this fascinating world or in a new one
 My conclusion is that authors should not narrate their own books She has probably imagened the voices as she wrote the book but they are bad Only finished because I am travelling and didn t have another book to listen to Lesson learned span span div

 Ginger is a medium in the Spirit Corp devised by the British Army during the First World War to take reports from the soldiers who are killed at the front before they pass on to provide the army with any information which might be useful to the war effort It is harrowing work requiring experiencing each of the soldiers deaths while taking their reports and like a lot of work during the war which wasn t combat it is done mostly by women the elderly and wounded veterans However then one span span id freeText style display none Ginger is a medium in the Spirit Corp devised by the British Army during the First World War to take reports from the soldiers who are killed at the front before they pass on to provide the army with any information which might be useful to the war effort It is harrowing work requiring experiencing each of the soldiers deaths while taking their reports and like a lot of work during the war which wasn t combat it is done mostly by women the elderly and wounded veterans However then one soldier reports that there might be a traitor in the army leaking information to the Germans and they might be after the Spirit Corp Ginger soon finds that her superiors won t take her seriously because she is a woman and dismiss her concerns So she does they only thing she can try to track down the traitor herself br br The Spirit Corp is a wonderful inventions not only for the tactical benefits it provides the war The mediums can see auras This allows Ginger to see through a character s outward appearance to read their true emotions and in a time of war there is a lot going on under the surface from characters being deceitful and misleading to people trying to present a brave front when they are in fact terrified br br There is a whole host of really interesting characters in this book and they really reflect the diversity of people who were at the front I loved reading about Ginger and her fiance s relationship Kowal has said that she wants to write about good functional relationships and that shows It doesn t mean there isn t conflict but it doesn t come from them fighting or disagreeing which is lovely to read br br Despite the magical element this book still holds up to being a really good historical novel which gives good insight into life at the front This the the first of Kowal s novels that I have read but I will definitely be picking up more

 Yet another awesome book by Kowal following in the footsteps of the Glamourist Histories but completely its own thing Ghost Talkers exists where spiritualism is real the soldiers are in the trenches and Sherlock Holmes is Iron Man br Kowal s characters are complex and engaging as always but this book is definitely darker in tone than her regency books She will lead you smiling and laughing up the path until you start weeping in realization And it s amazing span span div
 MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL HOW DARE YOU TEAR ME APART LIKE THIS br br Ahem I picked up Ghost Talkers because I got to see Ms Kowal in person and she read from it and it sounded like a fascinating premise During World War I the British army has developed something called The Spirit Corps which on paper is there to encourage the troops and build up morale but in reality is a bunch of mediums who glean information from the ghosts of the fallen What a great idea for a book br br Our heroine Ginger is one of span span id freeText style display none MARY ROBINETTE KOWAL HOW DARE YOU TEAR ME APART LIKE THIS br br Ahem I picked up Ghost Talkers because I got to see Ms Kowal in person and she read from it and it sounded like a fascinating premise During World War I the British army has developed something called The Spirit Corps which on paper is there to encourage the troops and build up morale but in reality is a bunch of mediums who glean information from the ghosts of the fallen What a great idea for a book br br Our heroine Ginger is one of these mediums and an American heiress engaged to a captain in the intelligence corps Ginger s comfort-- as much as there is in WWI-- is shaken when a ghost reports to her that he was murdered in that very camp and destroyed entirely when a spoilery thing happens Ginger s attempt to solve what s happening takes her from the Spirit Corps headquarters to the front with cameo by JRR Tolkien himself to a POW camp It s a pretty straightforward mystery but it s beautifully and heartbreakingly written with great worldbuilding for a great idea It s also refreshingly diverse and female-centric something that I have found sadly lacking in a lot of WWI-era novels They re near the front lines yes but the Spirit Corps is largely composed of women and disabled people with quite a few POC including one i major i character and one minor one scattered in between br br So yes this is a brutal book by virtue of the setting if nothing else but it s wonderfully written Kowal will make you thank her for every twist and heartbreak Worth the read for everyone IMO

 I liked this book a lot It is intense and heartbreaking and the worldbuilding is interesting My only small complaint was that it got a little repetitive in the final act--there was a cycle of Ginger and her companions nearly getting caught as they investigate who might be looking to sabotage the mediums aiding in the war effort only to manage to slip away by the skin of their teeth only to get back into trouble again The first two thirds of the book were much better varied br The book is well span span id freeText style display none I liked this book a lot It is intense and heartbreaking and the worldbuilding is interesting My only small complaint was that it got a little repetitive in the final act--there was a cycle of Ginger and her companions nearly getting caught as they investigate who might be looking to sabotage the mediums aiding in the war effort only to manage to slip away by the skin of their teeth only to get back into trouble again The first two thirds of the book were much better varied br The book is well put together enough to keep you guessing as to who the traitor in the ranks might be There are certain people you re fairly sure it s not but everyone else is suspect I realized after I finished that I had correctly guessed who the traitor was fairly early on but the mystery was crafted well enough and enough other possibilities were introduced that when the reveal of the traitor s identity happened it made sense but hadn t been the obvious choice from the beginning I didn t feel that the characters should have figured it out long before or anything like that br This piece definitely has the right feel of a World War I-set story with the desperation to gain some kind of advantage to end the war mixed with the agony and despair of those on the front line and the clinging to small things that remind everyone of normal life MRK definitely does her homework for her historical fantasies and it shows Another solid story to add to her bibliography
 So I picked this up because I thought it would be a good introduction to Kowal s writing being a standalone novel br br It was in a way I enjoyed the prose and much of the book had a very atmospheric and perhaps charming feel to it That said I enjoyed the latter half more than the first and I think that is mainly because the book is about the use of mediums during WWI and I have a hard time getting past that for good reason I appreciate the writing and the story was decent sort of wartime es span span id freeText style display none So I picked this up because I thought it would be a good introduction to Kowal s writing being a standalone novel br br It was in a way I enjoyed the prose and much of the book had a very atmospheric and perhaps charming feel to it That said I enjoyed the latter half more than the first and I think that is mainly because the book is about the use of mediums during WWI and I have a hard time getting past that for good reason I appreciate the writing and the story was decent sort of wartime espionage mystery but I can t really recommend it
 So in this alternate universe mediums are part of the WWI war effort They ve given soldiers identity discs that guide their souls back to report in to the mediums Soldiers are encouraged to keep their eyes open at death so they can report some information that will save their comrades This was an intriguing and nicely complete universe just like ours except for one aspect I especially appreciated the inclusion of efforts to integrate the army by gender and race Don t expect a historical span span id freeText style display none So in this alternate universe mediums are part of the WWI war effort They ve given soldiers identity discs that guide their souls back to report in to the mediums Soldiers are encouraged to keep their eyes open at death so they can report some information that will save their comrades This was an intriguing and nicely complete universe just like ours except for one aspect I especially appreciated the inclusion of efforts to integrate the army by gender and race Don t expect a historical novel though there s no historical detail br br I m giving it stars instead of because the dream or medium sequences were sometimes a little too jarring Suddenly there s a long italicized about someone working on a door with a wrench and then it s gone with no explanation There should have been some statement like Ginger was losing her ability to shut out the thoughts of passing spirits I kept thinking I missed something When Ginger the protagonist relived Ben s death it started out with his thoughts on a traitor who had been executed but I guess it had nothing to do with the plot of the book or at least it wasn t explained again which was confusing since traitors were central to the main plot But still the book held my interest and the universe was intriguing book provided by netgalley com in exchange for an honest review
 A solid take on an alternate universe World War I where mediums and ghosts are used for intelligence collection Felt quite grounded in both how such a thing could plausibly work and also the realities of warfare in that time period making it a good read but not always a comforting one span span div
 I ve rated this a largely because of the premise spiritualist fantasy set in WWI The idea of using spiritualism to aid the war effort is refreshing after having read too many detective stories about fraudulent spiritualists who took advantage of people s grief Kowal s story instead asks readers to reconsider the benefits of spiritualism during a particularly bloody period of WWI when the dead seemed more prevalent than the living br br The plot of this novel is more aligned with the spy thrille span span id freeText style display none I ve rated this a largely because of the premise spiritualist fantasy set in WWI The idea of using spiritualism to aid the war effort is refreshing after having read too many detective stories about fraudulent spiritualists who took advantage of people s grief Kowal s story instead asks readers to reconsider the benefits of spiritualism during a particularly bloody period of WWI when the dead seemed more prevalent than the living br br The plot of this novel is more aligned with the spy thriller than with conventional - even historical - fantasy sadly as a result the plot took precedence over the worldbuilding I kept waiting for the novel to explain more of why spiritualism was regarded as witchcraft by the Germans why there were so many sensitives showing up around the world and just how closely the spiritualist movement depicted in the novel mirrored the one in real-life Britain at that time I probably feel this way in part because I m just coming off an N K Jemisin novel - always a perfect source for worldbuilding well-balanced with plot and character development br br Nonetheless I enjoyed Kowal s story and characters and it was hard to put the book down I was only left with more questions than answers not to mention a desire to pull more from the story than was actually present on the pages
 Another great book by Ms Kowal I enjoy reading about world war one in general and this book had a lot going for it It is fast pace well plotted and has great characters It shows what war can be like shows the tool it takes on everyone it shows a true love between two people and the depths they will go to to make sure everything turns out at least okay But is also shows that regardless of who you are you can contribute in a meaningful way It shows how important woman were to the war eff span span id freeText style display none Another great book by Ms Kowal I enjoy reading about world war one in general and this book had a lot going for it It is fast pace well plotted and has great characters It shows what war can be like shows the tool it takes on everyone it shows a true love between two people and the depths they will go to to make sure everything turns out at least okay But is also shows that regardless of who you are you can contribute in a meaningful way It shows how important woman were to the war effort It shows how woman could go above about what was considered of them at the time and rise above to accomplish great things that people back then should have already known It shows how men from marginalized and quiet frankly whom people where racist towards helped with the war Indian Black so on The add the fantasy type element with talking to ghost and you have an interpreting book that kept me reading and not wanting to finish it And of course there is the very emotional scene towards the end with the main character and her love and for spoiler reasons that I won t get into This is another wonderful book as I have stated by Ms Kowal and I highly recommend it
 An excellent blend of world-building plot and character While it doesn t get bogged down too much in period detail or building the story of the Spirit Corps there s enough background to hold everything together The plot moved quickly too - through some harrowing physical danger and emotional moments Ginger works for the Spirit Corps a top-secret group of mediums who interview the souls of recently killed British soldiers to gain intelligence that can be used against the Germans With Ge span span id freeText style display none An excellent blend of world-building plot and character While it doesn t get bogged down too much in period detail or building the story of the Spirit Corps there s enough background to hold everything together The plot moved quickly too - through some harrowing physical danger and emotional moments Ginger works for the Spirit Corps a top-secret group of mediums who interview the souls of recently killed British soldiers to gain intelligence that can be used against the Germans With German spies hunting for this British secret weapon Ginger her fiance and spy Ben and friends have to hunt down the spy and save the Spirit Corps While there are no dull moments there aren t any big surprises either that that s OK - the most fantastical moments in the book are due to the actual fantasy elements not to miraculous James Bond-type escapes and stunts I also liked that the author included some diversity in her cast and didn t get too shy to talk about the prejudice of the era A bit more authenticity when it came to class distinctions a la Downton Abbey might have been appropriate at times the relationships between characters felt a bit too modern Overall quite a good book I ll be going back to read this author s other offerings

 I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either span span id freeText style display none I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either br br The only problem I have with this book is that the action gets a little muddled as it goes along The characters travel back and forth between towns in France close to the front lines and if it takes a train three hours to make the trip I don t know that a person can walk the same distance in a night Also there s a pretty big twist in the solution of the central mystery that didn t seem totally plausible but maybe that s just me All in all this is a heartfelt story about war and duty and love and I hope there s a sequel

 I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing r span span id freeText style display none I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing relationship and how the two participants deal with what happens in the context of that The idea behind the ghost corp and the thought that went into it was also very impressive Mrs Kowal also did a great job in capturing the events of being on the front and didn t pull punches in who she killed I also suspected everyone in turn My initial suspect did turn out to be the spy but I definitely second guessed myself several times br As far as I know this is a standalone but I would definitely pick up another book in this world Especially if we got more Helen She was by far my favorite

 I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either span span id freeText style display none I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either br br The only problem I have with this book is that the action gets a little muddled as it goes along The characters travel back and forth between towns in France close to the front lines and if it takes a train three hours to make the trip I don t know that a person can walk the same distance in a night Also there s a pretty big twist in the solution of the central mystery that didn t seem totally plausible but maybe that s just me All in all this is a heartfelt story about war and duty and love and I hope there s a sequel

 This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn span span id freeText style display none This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn t engage me all that much but there were some lovely character moments that worked as wrenching emotional gut-punches I also loved the setting--the Battle of the Somme in WWI a war that has been overshadowed by its successor--and central conceit--that the British Army formed a Spirit Corps of mediums to gather intel from dead soldiers before they crossed over to the other side

 I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrib span span id freeText style display none I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrible decisions and while that creates a lot of plot it doesn t create good plot The rest of the cast is somewhat lackluster as well I just wish Kowal had spent more time fine tuning them giving the characters more depth and individuality br I m happy to give the series another shot if she comes out with a sequel

 Really an original idea and storyline that felt so well-researched and thought out that it seemed almost plausible I love an author that puts that much effort into their world-building and manages to make the reader believe in something they might not otherwise Perhaps though my small complaint is that there wasn t enough time left for the characters I m still not exactly sure why the exposed traitor chose to betray his country or what the main couples history entails I did still enj span span id freeText style display none Really an original idea and storyline that felt so well-researched and thought out that it seemed almost plausible I love an author that puts that much effort into their world-building and manages to make the reader believe in something they might not otherwise Perhaps though my small complaint is that there wasn t enough time left for the characters I m still not exactly sure why the exposed traitor chose to betray his country or what the main couples history entails I did still enjoy it and appreciated at least some tiny insights into various characters Ginger s love of brussel sprouts turned out to be a particularly endearing scene--who knew br br Overall I just loved the idea The historical aspects are easy to appreciate and the mystical aspects come off wonderfully Plus the cover is fantastic Judge it by its cover and try it out

 I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrib span span id freeText style display none I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrible decisions and while that creates a lot of plot it doesn t create good plot The rest of the cast is somewhat lackluster as well I just wish Kowal had spent more time fine tuning them giving the characters more depth and individuality br I m happy to give the series another shot if she comes out with a sequel

 I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either span span id freeText style display none I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either br br The only problem I have with this book is that the action gets a little muddled as it goes along The characters travel back and forth between towns in France close to the front lines and if it takes a train three hours to make the trip I don t know that a person can walk the same distance in a night Also there s a pretty big twist in the solution of the central mystery that didn t seem totally plausible but maybe that s just me All in all this is a heartfelt story about war and duty and love and I hope there s a sequel

 This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn span span id freeText style display none This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn t engage me all that much but there were some lovely character moments that worked as wrenching emotional gut-punches I also loved the setting--the Battle of the Somme in WWI a war that has been overshadowed by its successor--and central conceit--that the British Army formed a Spirit Corps of mediums to gather intel from dead soldiers before they crossed over to the other side

 I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing r span span id freeText style display none I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing relationship and how the two participants deal with what happens in the context of that The idea behind the ghost corp and the thought that went into it was also very impressive Mrs Kowal also did a great job in capturing the events of being on the front and didn t pull punches in who she killed I also suspected everyone in turn My initial suspect did turn out to be the spy but I definitely second guessed myself several times br As far as I know this is a standalone but I would definitely pick up another book in this world Especially if we got more Helen She was by far my favorite

 I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrib span span id freeText style display none I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrible decisions and while that creates a lot of plot it doesn t create good plot The rest of the cast is somewhat lackluster as well I just wish Kowal had spent more time fine tuning them giving the characters more depth and individuality br I m happy to give the series another shot if she comes out with a sequel

 This was good Quick read perhaps quicker than I should have read it since some things seemed to flash by and I m not sure whether they were well-written or not It was a fairly decent story interestingly twisty but not brilliantly so The characters were good but they all seemed like a rehash of the Mary Robinette Kowal casts I ve seen in her other works All in all a fairly good story but a fairly shallow one if that makes sense It seemed to use the reader s prior knowledge of World W span span id freeText style display none This was good Quick read perhaps quicker than I should have read it since some things seemed to flash by and I m not sure whether they were well-written or not It was a fairly decent story interestingly twisty but not brilliantly so The characters were good but they all seemed like a rehash of the Mary Robinette Kowal casts I ve seen in her other works All in all a fairly good story but a fairly shallow one if that makes sense It seemed to use the reader s prior knowledge of World War to inform it rather than describing it itself Same with the ghost-based magic system This of course is unavoidable but with an alternate history you d expect there to be some explanation of stuff I m no expert in France but I know enough about the war to fill in the details of the random French villages every World War story seems to feature br br Still not bad I enjoyed myself but not immensely

 I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either span span id freeText style display none I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either br br The only problem I have with this book is that the action gets a little muddled as it goes along The characters travel back and forth between towns in France close to the front lines and if it takes a train three hours to make the trip I don t know that a person can walk the same distance in a night Also there s a pretty big twist in the solution of the central mystery that didn t seem totally plausible but maybe that s just me All in all this is a heartfelt story about war and duty and love and I hope there s a sequel

 I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing r span span id freeText style display none I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing relationship and how the two participants deal with what happens in the context of that The idea behind the ghost corp and the thought that went into it was also very impressive Mrs Kowal also did a great job in capturing the events of being on the front and didn t pull punches in who she killed I also suspected everyone in turn My initial suspect did turn out to be the spy but I definitely second guessed myself several times br As far as I know this is a standalone but I would definitely pick up another book in this world Especially if we got more Helen She was by far my favorite

 I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either span span id freeText style display none I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either br br The only problem I have with this book is that the action gets a little muddled as it goes along The characters travel back and forth between towns in France close to the front lines and if it takes a train three hours to make the trip I don t know that a person can walk the same distance in a night Also there s a pretty big twist in the solution of the central mystery that didn t seem totally plausible but maybe that s just me All in all this is a heartfelt story about war and duty and love and I hope there s a sequel

 This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn span span id freeText style display none This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn t engage me all that much but there were some lovely character moments that worked as wrenching emotional gut-punches I also loved the setting--the Battle of the Somme in WWI a war that has been overshadowed by its successor--and central conceit--that the British Army formed a Spirit Corps of mediums to gather intel from dead soldiers before they crossed over to the other side

 I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrib span span id freeText style display none I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrible decisions and while that creates a lot of plot it doesn t create good plot The rest of the cast is somewhat lackluster as well I just wish Kowal had spent more time fine tuning them giving the characters more depth and individuality br I m happy to give the series another shot if she comes out with a sequel

 Really an original idea and storyline that felt so well-researched and thought out that it seemed almost plausible I love an author that puts that much effort into their world-building and manages to make the reader believe in something they might not otherwise Perhaps though my small complaint is that there wasn t enough time left for the characters I m still not exactly sure why the exposed traitor chose to betray his country or what the main couples history entails I did still enj span span id freeText style display none Really an original idea and storyline that felt so well-researched and thought out that it seemed almost plausible I love an author that puts that much effort into their world-building and manages to make the reader believe in something they might not otherwise Perhaps though my small complaint is that there wasn t enough time left for the characters I m still not exactly sure why the exposed traitor chose to betray his country or what the main couples history entails I did still enjoy it and appreciated at least some tiny insights into various characters Ginger s love of brussel sprouts turned out to be a particularly endearing scene--who knew br br Overall I just loved the idea The historical aspects are easy to appreciate and the mystical aspects come off wonderfully Plus the cover is fantastic Judge it by its cover and try it out

 I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrib span span id freeText style display none I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrible decisions and while that creates a lot of plot it doesn t create good plot The rest of the cast is somewhat lackluster as well I just wish Kowal had spent more time fine tuning them giving the characters more depth and individuality br I m happy to give the series another shot if she comes out with a sequel

 I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either span span id freeText style display none I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either br br The only problem I have with this book is that the action gets a little muddled as it goes along The characters travel back and forth between towns in France close to the front lines and if it takes a train three hours to make the trip I don t know that a person can walk the same distance in a night Also there s a pretty big twist in the solution of the central mystery that didn t seem totally plausible but maybe that s just me All in all this is a heartfelt story about war and duty and love and I hope there s a sequel

 This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn span span id freeText style display none This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn t engage me all that much but there were some lovely character moments that worked as wrenching emotional gut-punches I also loved the setting--the Battle of the Somme in WWI a war that has been overshadowed by its successor--and central conceit--that the British Army formed a Spirit Corps of mediums to gather intel from dead soldiers before they crossed over to the other side

 I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing r span span id freeText style display none I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing relationship and how the two participants deal with what happens in the context of that The idea behind the ghost corp and the thought that went into it was also very impressive Mrs Kowal also did a great job in capturing the events of being on the front and didn t pull punches in who she killed I also suspected everyone in turn My initial suspect did turn out to be the spy but I definitely second guessed myself several times br As far as I know this is a standalone but I would definitely pick up another book in this world Especially if we got more Helen She was by far my favorite

 I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrib span span id freeText style display none I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrible decisions and while that creates a lot of plot it doesn t create good plot The rest of the cast is somewhat lackluster as well I just wish Kowal had spent more time fine tuning them giving the characters more depth and individuality br I m happy to give the series another shot if she comes out with a sequel

 This was good Quick read perhaps quicker than I should have read it since some things seemed to flash by and I m not sure whether they were well-written or not It was a fairly decent story interestingly twisty but not brilliantly so The characters were good but they all seemed like a rehash of the Mary Robinette Kowal casts I ve seen in her other works All in all a fairly good story but a fairly shallow one if that makes sense It seemed to use the reader s prior knowledge of World W span span id freeText style display none This was good Quick read perhaps quicker than I should have read it since some things seemed to flash by and I m not sure whether they were well-written or not It was a fairly decent story interestingly twisty but not brilliantly so The characters were good but they all seemed like a rehash of the Mary Robinette Kowal casts I ve seen in her other works All in all a fairly good story but a fairly shallow one if that makes sense It seemed to use the reader s prior knowledge of World War to inform it rather than describing it itself Same with the ghost-based magic system This of course is unavoidable but with an alternate history you d expect there to be some explanation of stuff I m no expert in France but I know enough about the war to fill in the details of the random French villages every World War story seems to feature br br Still not bad I enjoyed myself but not immensely

 I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either span span id freeText style display none I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either br br The only problem I have with this book is that the action gets a little muddled as it goes along The characters travel back and forth between towns in France close to the front lines and if it takes a train three hours to make the trip I don t know that a person can walk the same distance in a night Also there s a pretty big twist in the solution of the central mystery that didn t seem totally plausible but maybe that s just me All in all this is a heartfelt story about war and duty and love and I hope there s a sequel

 I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing r span span id freeText style display none I m still not sure what to rate this one I enjoyed the story idea and characters but it moved slowly for me I think it may due to just my trying to complete it during the DiverseAThon when I was wanting to read other things but my active interest in it wasn t high I had to remind myself to pick it up and finish it br Like I said though I enjoyed almost everything about it I can t fault it for anything besides my own lack of interest I always enjoy entering a story with a pre-existing relationship and how the two participants deal with what happens in the context of that The idea behind the ghost corp and the thought that went into it was also very impressive Mrs Kowal also did a great job in capturing the events of being on the front and didn t pull punches in who she killed I also suspected everyone in turn My initial suspect did turn out to be the spy but I definitely second guessed myself several times br As far as I know this is a standalone but I would definitely pick up another book in this world Especially if we got more Helen She was by far my favorite

 I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either span span id freeText style display none I received a digital ARC of this book from Netgalley br br Mary Robinette Kowal has one of the best imaginations in fantasy fiction today She s responsible for the completely charming Glamourist Histories and now she s brought us Ghost Talkers a fascinating alternate history of the first World War where spiritualists aid in the war effort br br Another great think about Ms Kowal s writing is the care she takes to depict diversity History wasn t monochromatic and historical fiction shouldn t be either br br The only problem I have with this book is that the action gets a little muddled as it goes along The characters travel back and forth between towns in France close to the front lines and if it takes a train three hours to make the trip I don t know that a person can walk the same distance in a night Also there s a pretty big twist in the solution of the central mystery that didn t seem totally plausible but maybe that s just me All in all this is a heartfelt story about war and duty and love and I hope there s a sequel

 This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn span span id freeText style display none This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn t engage me all that much but there were some lovely character moments that worked as wrenching emotional gut-punches I also loved the setting--the Battle of the Somme in WWI a war that has been overshadowed by its successor--and central conceit--that the British Army formed a Spirit Corps of mediums to gather intel from dead soldiers before they crossed over to the other side

 I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrib span span id freeText style display none I love urban fantasy for a lot of different reasons but after a while the same old magic detective roaming around the mean streets of New York City gets to be repetitive This was a very welcome break from that trope I loved the idea of using the popularity of spiritualism in the s as a basis for the magic in the series I loved the use of spy-craft throughout Where it faltered was with the plot and the characters The lead Ginger is a capable medium but she runs gleefully toward terrible decisions and while that creates a lot of plot it doesn t create good plot The rest of the cast is somewhat lackluster as well I just wish Kowal had spent more time fine tuning them giving the characters more depth and individuality br I m happy to give the series another shot if she comes out with a sequel

 I had the hardest time trying to decide between and stars and here s why I knew this was going to be a good book Mary Robinette Kowal is just the best and I loved the premise so I was not bowled over by my reaction However I decided to tilt toward because the depths of the emotions and their direction did catch me off guard It s a story about wartime mediums who talk to men who have just died on the front Bad thing happens not too far into the story and you know there is going to b span span id freeText style display none I had the hardest time trying to decide between and stars and here s why I knew this was going to be a good book Mary Robinette Kowal is just the best and I loved the premise so I was not bowled over by my reaction However I decided to tilt toward because the depths of the emotions and their direction did catch me off guard It s a story about wartime mediums who talk to men who have just died on the front Bad thing happens not too far into the story and you know there is going to be some pain from that and yet the final blow still resonated There are a number of good plot twists but it is the emotional story that stuck with me Maybe I ll read listen to it a second time just to concentrate on the plot wiggles br br p s Yes I listened to the audiobook of this It is always a treat to hear MRK narrating one of her own works

 I loved this It s a wonderful idea mediums working with British soldiers in WWI with the spirits of deceased soldiers as a way of gathering intelligence Great characters Ginger the protagonist is a spunky take-charge kind of gal I adored Mrs Richardson the older knitter who knew how to get things done Helen who by rights should have been running everything except that she was a woman of color Cpl Patel the driver who was a medium himself and Aunt Edie who knew her limits It eve span span id freeText style display none I loved this It s a wonderful idea mediums working with British soldiers in WWI with the spirits of deceased soldiers as a way of gathering intelligence Great characters Ginger the protagonist is a spunky take-charge kind of gal I adored Mrs Richardson the older knitter who knew how to get things done Helen who by rights should have been running everything except that she was a woman of color Cpl Patel the driver who was a medium himself and Aunt Edie who knew her limits It even has J R R Tolkien in a walk-on role Since I had recently read John Garth s book about Tolkien s experiences in WWI I got a real kick out of seeing him as a character in this book br br It s war so people do die but Kowal doesn t get maudlin on us I was very surprised at who died and I never suspected who the traitor might be until that person was revealed This was a lot of fun br
 This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn span span id freeText style display none This is one I m thinking I ll go back to in a few years It s definitely a well-written book but for some reason it didn t resonate very strongly with me I think maybe if I d read it more quickly I would have been more caught up with the character s plights It s also possible that being a fan of Kowal s other work it all felt very familiar br br All of this comes down to me not gushing over it as much as I ve seen other readers gush Even if I didn t love it I liked it quite a bit The plot didn t engage me all that much but there were some lovely character moments that worked as wrenching emotional gut-punches I also loved the setting--the Battle of the Somme in WWI a war that has been overshadowed by its successor--and central conceit--that the British Army formed a Spirit Corps of mediums to gather intel from dead soldiers before they crossed over to the other side
