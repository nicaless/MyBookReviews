# First Meeting
##Chapter 1-4.5
So this is less like Pride and Prejudice and more like Downton Abbey now.  It's probably the London setting.

And the matchmaking and the light political drama surrounding the coldmongers.  

Jane and Vincent are so adamant about the scientific impossibilities of glamour not having an effect on the weather.  Does anyone think they'll actually get proven wrong?

Thought that at first, but I think the story is going to take a "Global Warming: Fact of Fiction" type turn.  Like, there will be people who want to blame the coldmongers, and then the smart people that know what's up.  It would go nicely alongside Jane's apparent prejudice against Irish Catholics.  People shouldn't be prejudiced against coldmongers, or people of color, or glamourists.  

That would package things up a little too nicely.  

You did say we were reading a Downton Abbey and not a Jane Austen.  

Well, I do really like the London setting.  

#Second Meeting
##Chapter 4.5-6.5
Shall we place bets on who Melody will marry?

Or what will become of Vincent and his sister when they finally reunite?

I'm just here for the ride.  Well, I am a little disappointed we've gone back to glamurals and Tableau Vivents rather than experimentations with glamour recordings.

Vincent did have that scene where he simulated the sound of explosions.  

Kind of ironic right? When they were so adamant about explaining how glamour cannot actually explode anything.  

Yes, we may yet see more cool glamour feats.  But this time I'm more interested in the drama, especially where this is more external drama as opposed to the internal marriage drama of the last book.

Definitely liking this one better.  

So, we're placing bets, right?

# Third Meeting
## Chapter 6.5-END

Of course it was a volcano!  

Once they dropped that hint with the volcano in the newspaper, it all made sense.  I was starting to get convinved that all this hammering on the head that "glamour can't effect the weather" was misleading us.  

Did you think it was the coldmongers? You totally thought it was the coldmongers.  

No I didn't!

Will's death was so sad.  

On a happier note, totally called Melody and Alastair were gonna get married!  

Come on, no one was actually placing any bets against you for that.  

That courtroom drama was awesome.  

Totally.  Definitely my favorite book in the series so far!

Well, the next book is supposed to have pi-

Hey, no spoilers!
