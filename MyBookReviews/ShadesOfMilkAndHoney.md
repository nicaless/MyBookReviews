# First Meeting
So we're here because-

Because we happened to really like that other Mary Robinette Cowal book and now we're reading this weird Jane Austen knock-off?

I barely got through the first chapter.  The whole glamour thing is kinda interesting but overall? Snore.

I do commend that it does feel very much like Jane Austen would have written it.

Really? Well, I've only read Pride and Prejudice and that book pretty much started off with women NOT caring about looking for a rich man to marry.

You sure you read Pride and Prejudice and not Pride and Prejudice and Zombies?

Oooh let's do that one next?

Come on gang, it's only the first chapter.  We're only getting to know these girls.

And they feel kind of bland.  Hoepfully we'll get some dimension once we get start getting some plot.

No plot yet! 

Well besides the whole "how do i get my sister married to a good husband and woe is my I am a spinster"

I think the glamour thing's gonna be a great storyline.  Mr. Vincent will probably be a Wise Old Mentor type trope to Jane and she learns to be a great Glamourist.  

The glamour thing is really the only thing doing it for me.

It's not doing it for me...

I like the quaint countryside drama!  

And you're the only one.  Did I mention the only plot is the "how do i get my sister married to a good husband and woe is my I am a spinster"

... yeah ..

So Mr. Vincent's not exactly the Wise Old Mentor, but totally is starting to serve out the role by giving Jane his notebook.  I wonder what the initals "VH" stands for? V obviously has to stand for Vincent.  Maybe it's the name of a man he's in love with and he took his name.  

God, that sounds worse than the story in one of Beth's books.  

Pssh let's talk about Mr. Livingston.  Of course he's having some clandestine thing with Melody, but with Beth too! Man this is even better than what I was expecting.

Hang on, it's not been completely confirmed that Mr. Livingston's got a thing going on with Melody.

Pretty much though, and probably multiple girls too.  It's actually pretty clever.  Messed up and unoriginal, but clever.

How can one be clever _and_ unoriginal?

This whole book is advertised as a copycat Jane Austen with magic.  

I take that back.  

Forget that romance crap!  This storyline with Mr. Vincent just got so so much better.  

Fine.  Thoughts on what comes next?

Totally rooting for a Mr. Vincent/Jane romance.

FORGET THAT ROMANCE CRAP!

...

Actually, that would be kinda interesting.

I liked the horses!

Yeah, you're not reading the next book in this series with us.

Shit's gonna go down in Bath isn't it?

What do you think?

Livingston and Melody are going to elope! 

I mean some shit's gonna go down with Jane and 'Edmund' while everyone's away.  

Oh, sure that too.  

Timing is key.  Jane and Mr. Dunkirk get it on, then they find out about Livingston and Beth and then about Livingston and Melody or the other way around.  

I'm still hoping for a Jane and Mr. Vincent romance... but yeah shit's going down.
