# Out of Wedlock

## Meeting 1

Trashy lesbian romance novel at its finest.  Complete with tropes such as fake marriage with a side straight woman pretends to be lesbian, and hate each others guts at first sight, which of course should lead to really angsty slow burn, among other things we're sure to see as we progress.

Trashy lesbian romance novel indeed.  Perfect palate cleanser.  I'm loving it so far.  

Cringe worthy at times, mostly because Addison is such a bitch, but I guess they're really selling it on the one of them is a filthy rich asshole trope too.
