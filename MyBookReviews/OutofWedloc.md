# Out of Wedlock

## Meeting 1

Trashy lesbian romance novel at its finest.  Complete with tropes such as fake marriage with a side straight woman pretends to be lesbian, and hate each others guts at first sight, which of course should lead to really angsty slow burn, among other things we're sure to see as we progress.

Trashy lesbian romance novel indeed.  Perfect palate cleanser.  I'm loving it so far.  

Cringe worthy at times, mostly because Addison is such a bitch, but I guess they're really selling it on the one of them is a filthy rich asshole trope too.

## Meeting 2

Okay! To add to our list of tropes:

- Getting used to being rich and then worrying about losing their sense of self
- Slowly starting to be less of an asshole because you start thinking the person you're being an asshole to is actually hot and you want to bang her
- Angry sex
- Adopting a cute doggy
- Not so angry make-up sex after the angry sex
- Gratuitous sex scenes (Well why else are we reading this book!)
- And many more perhaps?

Well, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I'm not sure I liked the ending all that much.  Kind of wanted a more definitive "breaking the curse" type of ending, and preferably with a make-up between Joanna and Addison before the kids were born.  

That "curse" thing was pretty interesting and I'm disappointed it wasn't explored more, and the ending still wrapped things up well even if it wasn't your preference.  

Definitely keeping Lyn Gardner on the list for a future trashy romance novel palate cleanser.
