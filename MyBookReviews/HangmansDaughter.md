### First Meeting
So we're reading this creepy book because...

Nex's sister suggested it.

Also it's a best seller in multiple countries! 

And we got it for free!

You got it for free how did that happen?

Anyway... first impressions?

Besides it being creepy AF... kids dying, innocent women being tortured

but is she realllly innocent

shut up I'm making a point. Oh that guy with the bone hand.. but I'm a sucker for period dramas so...

And mysteries! 

Yes mysteries too!  This is classic whodunnit.  Just, you know, in a backwater German town in the middle of the 1600s.

That itself is creepy and cringeworthy.  

Seriously though the innocent women being tortured thing makes me queasy.  

The big question is: Witchcraft? Real or not?

Definitely not.  

Nope. Don't believe it.  

Well, Jacob and Simon are convinced it's not so I'm certain their going to get proven wrong.

Pretty sure Magdelena is a "witch".  Like they'll unveil her as a "witch"... and then they'll show it's all just crazy alchemy or botany or other science.

The guy with the bone hand though...

Yeah that's a tough one.  

Guess we'll have to wait and see.
