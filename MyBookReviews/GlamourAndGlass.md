# First Meeting
So, we all agreed we enjoyed the first book...

We did?  

And that's why we've begun the second book in this series.  You know, instead of picking up one of the more esteemed books on our to-read list.

Psss. Esteemed, shesteemed.  This book started off great.  More glamour and magic and art in this than posh romance.  Huge improvement.  Can't wait to see the fruits of the efforts to record glamour.  It's fascinating and enjoyable in that fact alone.  

It actually started reading like a fanfiction to me.  Like, the couple you were shipping finally got together and here's the idyllic slice of life story of their life together.

Well there definitely is that, but there's obviously more story brewing.  I'm eager to see where these clear Bonapartist tensions are going.
