# First Meeting 
## Chapter 1-9
So, we all agreed we enjoyed the first book...

We did?  

And that's why we've begun the second book in this series.  You know, instead of picking up one of the more esteemed books on our to-read list.

Psss. Esteemed, shesteemed.  This book started off great.  More glamour and magic and art in this than posh romance.  Huge improvement.  Can't wait to see the fruits of the efforts to record glamour.  It's fascinating and enjoyable in that fact alone.  

It actually started reading like a fanfiction to me.  Like, the couple you were shipping finally got together and here's the idyllic slice of life story of their life together.

Well there definitely is that, but there's obviously more story brewing.  I'm eager to see where these clear Bonapartist tensions are going. 

# Second Meeting  
## Chapter 9-14
Trouble in paradise it seems.

Of course.  There has to be or we'd remain in fanfiction land for the rest of the book, and that's not fun.  

Part of me wants to chock up Jane's paranoia to pregnancy hormones, and Vincent's dodginess to blackmail from Skiffy.

... The latter would be far more interesting. ... Which is kinda unfair.

Likely it's both.  

Likely.

Also likely, Jane has a miscarriage.  

Yeah. As I said.  Kinda unfair.  

On a happy note, that guy with the sheep.

That guy with the sheep! My hero.  

# Third Meeting
## Chapter 14
Slow week huh guys.

Pivotal chapter though guys! A way to record glamour! We now know why it's called glamour in glass.  Can't believe we're more than halfway through the book.

And yet the only plot we've had so far is the marriage troubles thing. ... Okay and the glamour in glass thing but whatever.

I'm sure the way the two plot points come together will be interesting.  

It better.    

# Fourth Meeting
## Chapter 14-21.5
THE SHEEP ARE CODE!

COOLEST THING EVER! 

Did not see that one coming, even though the sheep thing was quite peculiar. 

Anyway, poor Vincent, but I'm a little confused: I thought it was established in the last book that glamour would be useless in the battlefield.

I believe it has something to do with how the glamour folds or ties of the _Sphere Obscurcie_ come together.  It's a movable glamour.

Ah makes sense, makes sense.  

Also makes sense that the "spy" is Anne-Marie.  And hey, you totally called that that one soldier - Lieutenant Segal - would return.  

Yeah but I was thinking he'd be more of a counter to Vincent for all the "trouble in paradise" issues we'd been seeing.

And speaking of which, how badass is it that Jane - completely out of her element AND PREGNANT - is essentially taking on the whole Napolean army to get her husband back.  

Yeah pretty badass, but the likely ending is that Lord Hamilton pays a ransom.  

Indeed, but we shall see.  I just hope some hefty glamor is involved, a la the ending of the last book. 

#Fifth Meeting
## Chapter 21.5-24.5
So we've now witnessed the "woman-cross-dressing-as-a-man" trope in two of Mary Robinette Kowal's books so far.

Good trope.  Jane's a badass if that helps.  

That rescue scene was awesome! Forget about Lord Hamilton and Lord Gilman and the Prince.  Jane's got this.  

Don't speak too soon! Napolean may yet catch them in the rye.  

#Sixth Meeting
## Chapter 24.5-End
That was kinda sad.

And rushed.  

Ironic that Jane loses her baby while wearing men's clothing.

I wouldn't read too much into that.  There was plenty of miscarriage foreshadowing.  

Yeah, like the fact that there are at least two other books in the series that have summaries that don't in the least imply they have a child.  

That's probably why the ending felt rushed.  Follow up books are kind of implied.  Why stress on a conclusive ending for this one?  

Pfft.  That's kind of like cheating isn't it?  Any hopes for the next book?

More about recording glamour.

And probably a real aftermath to the events of this book?

And a real honeymoon! 

Well if that wasn't reason enough to read the next one...
