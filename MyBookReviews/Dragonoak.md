## First Book - First Meeting

So, tell us about this book.  Besides that it's rather obscure and sounds like a special healing tree bark that you'd find in a fantasy novel.

Well, it's a fantasy novel - 

Makes sense.  

That's supposedly with a cast with a diverse set of characters but is otherwise your standard fantasy adventure novel.

What makes you say that?  

Because the main character is not white and one of the other characters is considered an "other" that faces discrimination and supposedly there will be a homosexual relationship -

Oh I meant why you think it's just your standard fantasy adventure novel? 

Did you hear my thing about the special healing tree back name for a title?

Shut up, that's not reason enough.  Anyway, it just feels like it.  We're only a few chapters in, but the set up is very standard of that type of novel.  Small town main character that isn't what they seem on the surface leaves for the big wide open world and gets themself into a whole lot of shit with tough, stoic other main character and comic relief other side character giving intentionally vague explanations of what's going to build mystery and suspense for no real reason except that it's what the formula requires.

Eh, fair enough.  

Oh, I'm still enjoying it of course! A new world is always fascinating at the start.  We'll just have to see how the rest of the novel goes after this exposition piece is done.  

  
## First Book - Second Meeting

Ah so not only does the book have diverse characters, but it also addresses some diversity issues.  Mainly, prejudices and discrimination.  

Ah, but we figured that out already.  

Yeah, but just in case it wasn't blatant and in your face.

Why can't we have a diverse story without having to also slog through the second hand shame or embarrassment of a character being an ass or being the butt of some other character being an ass.

Come again now?

It's because we can't have nice things yet.  Also because it's unrealistic.  

This is a fantasy story!  

Stories should reflect reality.  And a Knight deserting their duty, a young girl running away from home, those are real stories set in a fantasy world that are only interesting if the fantasy world is believable.  

Pretty sure there's more to Sir Ightham's journey that deserting and dragons.  

Of course, but that needs to unravel slowly.  

Of course.  

Anyway, we've also added Michael to our motley crew of adventurers.  

He's annoying.

I think he'll grow on us.  

And every party should have a bard. 

## First Book - Third Meeting

So we finally find out that Sir Ightham's real name is Claire. 

And she's a Princess!

Forget Claire, Ran is Queen Kouris!

Admittedly, we all should have anticipated that.

And we still don't know everything.  We're a third into the book.  Shouldn't all the exposition be done by now?

Nah, at this point, Claire and Ran's, excuse me, Kouris's intentions are baked into the plot as a mystery, and it's reveal will be another end of book twist.  

These characters are awesome though.  I think that's what's selling this story and not the plot.  

Indeed.  I'm perfectly happy with this slow reveal of details for these intriguing characters so long as the reveal keeps them interesting and awesome.    

So what do you think is in store when we meen Queen Kidira?  

Hopefully exactly what I said.  Reveal of more interesting details.

I'm hoping we'll figure out what Rowan left her home for soon.  Of course there needs to be more than just interesting characters and worlds for a story to work.  We need a believable story, and right now traipsing about different towns and cities just because is not cutting it.  Yes, we get it.  It's a mystery, the characters don't want to reveal it because... because why?  Are we even brought to care?

Hey, be patient.  The pace of the story has just changed.  Let's wait to see what that means for us readers.

## First Book - Fourth Meeting

They kissed!

My goodness is that all we're going to talk about in this meeting?

That slow burn was frustrating and will only get more frustrating I'm so happy with how this book is turning out!

This is really all we're going to talk about in this meeting.  What about Claire's brother's betrothal to Kidira's daughter?

THEY KISSED!

Ok this meeting is over.

## First Book - Fifth Meeting

Well, that's interesting.  The reason that dragons are attacking Felheim is because the leaders ordered their slaying in the first place.  

Fits well with the themes of prejudice and racism in the book.  Everyone's afraid of dragons because of the actions of a few, which were only provoked because some people wanted to get rid of them because they felt mildly threatened by them for no valid reason.  

I hope that reason is revealed later though.  But I agree, it's probably something along the lines of, "The dragons are different, just like the pane.  And they're hiding in our lands, so... let's get a bunch of people to slay them.  Make sense."

Totally.  Now can we finish the book to see if that's the case?
