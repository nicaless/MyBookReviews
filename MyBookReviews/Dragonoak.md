So, tell us about this book.  Besides that it's rather obscure and sounds like a special healing tree bark that you'd find in a fantasy novel.

Well, it's a fantasy novel - 

Makes sense.  

That's supposedly with a cast with a diverse set of characters but is otherwise your standard fantasy adventure novel.

What makes you say that?  

Because the main character is not white and one of the other characters is considered an "other" that faces discrimination and supposedly there will be a homosexual relationship -

Oh I meant why you think it's just your standard fantasy adventure novel? 

Did you hear my thing about the special healing tree back name for a title?

Shut up, that's not reason enough.  Anyway, it just feels like it.  We're only a few chapters in, but the set up is very standard of that type of novel.  Small town main character that isn't what they seem on the surface leaves for the big wide open world and gets themself into a whole lot of shit with tough, stoic other main character and comic relief other side character giving intentionally vague explanations of what's going to build mystery and suspense for no real reason except that it's what the formula requires.

Eh, fair enough.  

Oh, I'm still enjoying it of course! A new world is always fascinating at the start.  We'll just have to see how the rest of the novel goes after this exposition piece is done.
