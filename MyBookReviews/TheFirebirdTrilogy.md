## The Firebird Trilogy

It's been a while since we all met, but since we've all finished A Thousand Pieces of You, and now all completely engrossed in the Firebird Trilogy by Claudia Gray, I figured we should revive this book club.

Yes, "book club."

YA love story and multidimensional travel? Who could resist.

Yeah, the different setting and kind of genre change every few chapters makes it fun.  

I also appreciate the commentary on science vs. art, on the nature of "destiny", and also the glimpses of life in Berkeley as an academic.  Really speaks to me.  

The different characters are pretty interesting too.  

They'd better be or I wouldn't be able to stomach the YA romace part of this story.  Even with all the genre changes, we don't ever really get away from that.

It is the core of the story.  They reeled you in with this cool sci-fi premise, but actually you're sticking around because of all this romance and destiny talk.  

That's good writing for you.  

Anyway, we're about half-way through the second book in the trilogy, Ten Thousand Skies Above you, thoughts on what will happen next?  

Marguerite realizes all this destiny crap isn't real and Paul will have to rewrite his thesis?  

I'm hoping for more Wyatt Conley backround and story presence.  

I'm betting, cliffhanger ending so we get suckered into buying the next book.  

That was going to happen anyway. 

You never know.  We're only half-way.  This book could turn out to be a bust.
