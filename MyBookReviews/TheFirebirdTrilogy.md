## The Firebird Trilogy

It's been a while since we all met, but since we've all finished A Thousand Pieces of You, and now all completely engrossed in the Firebird Trilogy by Claudia Gray, I figured we should revive this book club.

Yes, "book club."

YA love story and multidimensional travel? Who could resist.

Yeah, the different setting and kind of genre change every few chapters makes it fun.  

I also appreciate the commentary on science vs. art, on the nature of "destiny", and also the glimpses of life in Berkeley as an academic.  Really speaks to me.  

The different characters are pretty interesting too.  

They'd better be or I wouldn't be able to stomach the YA romace part of this story.  Even with all the genre changes, we don't ever really get away from that.

It is the core of the story.  They reeled you in with this cool sci-fi premise, but actually you're sticking around because of all this romance and destiny talk.  

That's good writing for you.  

Anyway, we're about half-way through the second book in the trilogy, Ten Thousand Skies Above you, thoughts on what will happen next?  

Marguerite realizes all this destiny crap isn't real and Paul will have to rewrite his thesis?  

I'm hoping for more Wyatt Conley background and story presence.  

I'm betting, cliffhanger ending so we get suckered into buying the next book.  

That was going to happen anyway. 

You never know.  We're only half-way.  This book could turn out to be a bust.  

## Second Meeting

So far we've met a Marguerite who chose Theo over Paul, a Wyatt Conley who's in love with Josie, a Paul who's a Russian mobster.  Destiny is a fickle thing it seems.

Such is the theme of the second book.  In the first book we were so convinced that Paul's hypothesis on destiny is true.  This one challenges that - typical trilogy cycle.  

Yeah, but we as the reader were always pretty skeptical about that, especially since our narrator perspective in Marguerite was too easily convinced.  Your destiny should be made up by your choices, not by patterns in personality and character.  The whole reason for multiple dimensions is because of differing choices among individuals after all.  We knew as much in the first book.  

Anyway, I was hoping for more Wyatt Conley page time, and we got it! Looking forward to this next section of the book.

Me too! And this Russian mobster Paul is interesting in himself.  

By the way, does anyone else find it unfair that we're getting to know Paul through other kinds of Paul.  We've already had more page time with the real Theo than Paul and Paul is supposed to be Marguerite's love interest.  Interesting deviation from the usual YA romance isn't it?  

Well if we are following typical trilogy patterns, than that might remedied in the third book?

Whoa let's not get ahead of ourselves!


## Third Meeting

Last book of the series.  How are we doing?  

So glad Paul's back together now, and it should be interesting how he and Marguerite cope with this change in him.  We're finally getting to know him after only really getting to know pieces of him or other-world hims in the last book.

Also, I'm liking this Wicked Marguerite person.  I'm a little annoyed with Wicked Theo, but I think that's the intention.  

And we're continuing the discourse on the the whole "what is destiny" question too, which is always nice.  

Does this book feel more action-y than the first two?  

The second was definitely more action-y than the first.  This one maybe is on par, and I think it's more thrill-y?  And we just started too with just the couple new worlds we've visited.  

Yeah, great start!
