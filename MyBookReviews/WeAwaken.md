# We Awaken 

## Beginning

Feels like typical formula YA/coming of age/self-discovery/mystical story.  Except the self-discovery part centers around the main character, Victoria's, asexuality.  

Agree with all the above points.  The dream creature is an interesting concept, but I'm not sure it's that original.  I am pretty happy that the picture being painted of asexuality is accurate at the same time as not feeling textbook.  This is good.  Very good.

It certainly helps that the form is first-person... [what type of first-person].  We can better empathize with Victoria.  

Anyway, I like the concept and the story is engaging.  I don't think I've hit the 'oh wow! can't put it down' point yet, if it's here.

Good start all around.  

... Alright should we take a nap or something or keep reading?  

## Ending Thoughts
So, I'll be honest my overall feeling of the book is lukewarm.  

I'm with you.  I applaud the effort to educate young people about asexuality, even if it was a bit didactic at times, but the overall story wasn't that strong for me.

Yeah, I liked the characters, and the concept started off cool, but for some reason, the whole of it didn't follow through for me.  

The story itself is solid though, if not engaging for the individuals in this book club.  I'd still recommend it to young people who are interested.
