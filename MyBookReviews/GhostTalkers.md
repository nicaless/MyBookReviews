### First Meeting
So why are we reading this book?

pitched in that one podcast Nex is always listening to

ok who started reading it? Anyone

...

ok well..

I like the premise of it.  Kind of refreshing.  And I'm a sucker for period dramas so...

And mysteries! 

Yes mysteries too!  

Is this a scary book?  It has ghosts in the title.  I'm not up for a scary book at the moment.

It's a real Stephen King.

No seriously you should start reading it.  

The characters are likeable enough.  

Maybe a bit tropey though?  It starts out feeling like a typical romance novel.

And romances! 

Yes romances too!  

Well we're only a few chapters in... those of us that have started let's predict the ending!

Is this whole book club going to be about predicting the ending?

Literally we just started.  Not that far in yet to predict the ending.

Going all out here: Ben is the murderer.

Ben dies!  

Ben is the murderer AND Ben dies!

Don't think Ben is the murderer, but maybe he gets accused.

The murderer is obviously linked to whoever leaked the info about the Spirit Corps.

Oh but how twisty would it be if it wasn't!

### Second Meeting
Well shit how come no one predicted Ben would die.

So twisty! I love it.

I know! Now things are getting interesting.  

Also I totally didn't think he'd be force to stay and take care of the unfinished business of his murder.

Yeah.  At first I would have been more on board if he had passed on and the rest of the book would just have been about Ginger grieving and solving the mystery-

And coming to terms with Ben's death through solving the mystery-

Exactly.  I thought the whole ghost boyfriend thing was a bit cliche... But whatever I like it!

Came for the mystery, stayed for the paranormal romance.  

Basically.

### Third Meeting
And now we're at the front!

And we were still right about Ben being under suspicion for murder.

Yeah yeah predictable.  Let's talk about how the novel should NOT go in the direction of Ginger and Merrow getting together.

Or Ginger using Merrow as a proxy for Ben, just like she used herself as a proxy so Ben could shoot those creeps.

That's exactly where you'd think it will go.

I bet Merrow did it and they're trying to red-herring Ben's cousin.

50% through.  We'll have to wait and see.

### Fourth Meeting
Tolkien's in this book!

It's awesome!  

Yeah, also I bet Axtell is a red herring.  

Total red herring.  But I don't like him so I hope he sticks around.

Also again we totally called Ben possessing Merrow.  

It didn't happen.  In fact they took away the possibility that it might happen.  

I'm still thinking it will happen.  Also, that Reginald wants Merrow dead sort of hints more to me that he and Ginger will kick it.

But Merrow's got "friends" among the nurses.  

Anyway, he could be dead in the trench now.

Speaking of which, who ended up researching what the hell's a listening trench?

Forget that I looked up Tolkien's bio again!

### Fifth Meeting
Well, since we last met up we-

I finished the book!

What already?

Me too!

What the fuck? Don't spoil anything.  We gotta meet up later.  I'm only just at the part where they left Amiens to get away from Reginald's men.

---
### Sixth Meeting

Fucking called it that Merrow was up to no good! 

How about that ending though?

Ghost army.  That was prety wicked.  

Wicked?  What about that ghost torture scene?  Bit weird to anyone?  

Exactly.  

The whole ghost possession thing for one last romance was definitely called for though.

Called that too!  Of course it would have been with Reginald though.

Hey some of this fooled by Merrow-

Only fooled for a little bit

Thought he'd be the one getting possessed.

It was a nice end.  

Sure was.  

The whole "unfinished business" motif definitely leaves me wanting more.  

Sign of a good book.

But really freaking frustrating!
